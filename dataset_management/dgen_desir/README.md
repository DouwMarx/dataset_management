    First resonance region: [4000, 6500] rpm
    Second resonance region: [8000, 10000] rpm
    Third resonance region: [37500, 42500] rpm

I would recommend using the first 4 configurations (so config 1,2,3,4) / rampe / (donnees perfo for the speed and donnees vibroacoustique for the data) / (then from the 16 IDs I would recommend using 2, 7, 15 or 16)
