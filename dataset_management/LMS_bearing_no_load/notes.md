LOR means large outer race, MIR means medium inner race, SOR means Small outer race

each signal corresponds to one continuous measurement starting at 5rps, ramp up up to 10rps, stay at 10rps, then ramp up to 20 rps, etc 
If you want to select one steady speed, you need to truncate/segment the signal based on the speed signal
